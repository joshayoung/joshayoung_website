<h1>Axioms</h1>
<p>These are some axioms that relate to software development that I have found useful and instructive over the years.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Good Function - is very small and does very little (ideally one thing).</li>
<li>&quot;You will never know less than you know right now.&quot; - Practical Object-Oriented Design (book)</li>
<li>&quot;Make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change.&quot; -Kent Beck</li>
<li>&quot;Depending on an abstraction is always safer than depending on a concretion because by its very nature, the abstraction is more stable.&quot; - Practical Object-Oriented Design (book)</li>
<li>&quot;Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.&quot; - Abraham Lincoln</li>
<li>&quot;Slow is smooth smooth is fast&quot; - Navy Seals</li>
<li>Discovery: build the right product.</li>
<li>Delivery: built the product right.</li>
</ul>
