<p>I recently made the switch to Atom from Sublime Text 2. My first thoughts are that the Vim support is much better. Over the years, I have tried a few different code editors, but Atom is by far the best.</p>
<p>I have found the following plugins useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>vim-mode</li>
<li>ex-mode</li>
<li>color-picker</li>
<li>relative-numbers</li>
<li>git-plus</li>
<li>git-time-machine</li>
<li>todo-show</li>
</ul>
