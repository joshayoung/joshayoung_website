            <h1>Clean Code Takeaways</h1>

    <main>
<p>I recently started reading Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. Over the years, I have heard high praise from people who have found this book helpful, and I have finally found the time to start reading it. So far I find this to be an excellent book. As I continue reading it, I will update this post with my general conclusions which I have listed below:</p>
<h3>Main points of book:</h3>
<h4>Naming:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make variables meaningful.
<ul>
<li>Except when in loops, use longer variable names that are searchable and describe the purpose of the variable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Class names should be composed of nouns.</li>
<li>Method names should be composed of verbs.</li>
<li>Functions ideally should require zero argument.
<ul>
<li>The more arguments a function requires, the worse the function has become.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't use single letter variable names because they are hard to search for.</li>
<li>Make sure a variable has context by appending the context to the beginning of the name or, preferably, using a class.</li>
<li>Name variables in a way that meaning is clear without the need for a comment.</li>
<li>Never use the word 'variable' in a variable or the word 'table' in a table name, etc.</li>
<li>Use proper spelling for variable names.
<ul>
<li>Make sure they can be pronounced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Functions:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Functions should be as small as possible.
<ul>
<li>They should do only one thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a function can be divided into separate parts that accomplish different tasks, it is too large.</li>
<li>A function should only work on one level of abstraction.</li>
<li>Always use a longer name for a function, rather than a snort name with a comment describing it.</li>
<li>Always return a value from a function rather than changing its input argument.</li>
<li>Never use 'flag' arguments like 'true' or 'false' in a function.
<ul>
<li>Instead use two functions for each purpose that the flag would have toggled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A function written with more than two parameters would be better written as a class or broken up into multiple functions.
<ul>
<li>Also consider passing in an object to a function instead of two or more arguments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write functions in the form of verb(noun).
Also consider writing a function that spells out the expected order of arguments in the function name (i.e. doesCatEqualDog(cat, dog);).</li>
<li>A function call should not exhibit side affects. In other words, if a function is clearly designed to do one thing, it should not do something else that is not obvious (such as checking an argument's value, but also saving that argument as a cookie).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If possible, make your code more clear (proper function naming, etc) instead of relying on your comment to explain what you are doing with the code.</li>
<li>Comments have a tendancy to gradually become inaccurate as the code gets older.</li>
<li>Using long lists of changes at the top of a piece of code is no longer necessary due to version control systems.</li>
<li>Resist the urge to comment-out old code. This old code will be tracked by your version management, so delete it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Formatting:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chose a programming code-formatting style and stick to it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you are working as a part of a team, pick a style the team agrees to; and everyone on the team should abide by that style.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Variables should be defined close to where they will be used.</li>
<li>Control variables should be defined in the control structure (i.e. 'i' used in a loop).</li>
<li>Class variables should be defined at the top of the class.</li>
<li>When a function calls another function, the function that does the calling should be calling a function that has been defined vertically below its definition.</li>
<li>Line lengths of 120 characters or less are recommended.</li>
<li>He uses spacing according to the precedence of the operator (i.e. 2*3 + 4).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Testing:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Insure that your tests are clean and readable.</li>
<li>Make sure your tests are testing a single thing.</li>
<li>F.I.R.S.T.
<ul>
<li>Fast
<ul>
<li>Tests should run quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Independent
<ul>
<li>Each test should be independent and able to be executed on its own.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repeatable
<ul>
<li>You should be able to run the test in any environment (Dev, QA, Locally, etc).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-Validating
<ul>
<li>All tests should return a boolean (true or false).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Timely
<ul>
<li>Write the test for your production code immediately before writing the production code, not afterward.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Classes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Classes should start with all of your variables (public then private variables).</li>
<li>Classes should be small.</li>
<li>Classes should have a single responsibility.</li>
<li>A class name should describe its single responsibility.</li>
<li>A class should follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a></li>
</ul>
