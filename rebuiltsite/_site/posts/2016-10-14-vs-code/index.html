<p>After using Atom for a few months, I decided to give Visual Studio Code a try. After a few weeks of use, it really seems more polished than Atom. Although I like many of the features of Atom and still use it occasionally for specific tasks, I find VSCode more enjoyable to use.</p>
<p>The visual interface is more professional and the plugin integration is superb. The best part is that I now have an excellent editor that works on both my Mac and Linux machines and also supports Vim.</p>
<p>I have found a few very nice plugins for this code editor, which I have listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code Spellchecker</li>
<li>Path Intellisense</li>
<li>TODO Parser</li>
<li>Vim</li>
<li>Terminal</li>
<li>PHP Debug</li>
<li>Indent 4-to-2
<ul>
<li>Used to convert tabs or 4 spaces into 2 spaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
