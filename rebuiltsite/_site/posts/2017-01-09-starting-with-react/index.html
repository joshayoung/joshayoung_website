<p>I have always loved JavaScript. In fact, it is probably my favorite language. On the surface it seems simple. Indeed, the basic syntax is easy for anyone to pick-up. However, upon investigation, it is a very complex and powerful language. For a while now, I have been trying out a few of the different JavaScript frameworks.</p>
<p>They all have their pluses and minuses, but it seems that React gives you the most flexibility to use other systems for the back-end. After all, React is just a view. I have started taking Wes Bos' course on <a href="https://reactforbeginners.com">React</a> and found it very helpful. I plan to integrate React into some of my existing and new projects at work.</p>
