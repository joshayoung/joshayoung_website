Below are some of my favorite parts of the book: Scrum The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time by Jeff Sutherland and J. J. Sutherland.

- "Management didn't dictate. Instead, executives were servant leaders and facilitators focused on getting obstacles out of their teams' way rather then telling them what and how to do product development."
- "Don't look for bad people; look for bad systems â€” ones that incentivize bad behavior and reward poor performance."
- "Sprints are what are often called 'time boxes.' They'r of a set duration. You don't do a one-week Sprint and then a three-week Sprint. You have to be consistent. You want to establish a work rhythm where people know how much they can get done in a set period of time."
- "One crucial element of an individual Sprint, though, is that once the team commits to what they'r going to accomplish, the taasks are locked in. Nothing else can be added by anyone outside the team."
- "And what happens if you're interrupted or have to switch quickly to another project, even just for a monment? You guessed it: that carefully built mental architecture collapses. It can take hours of work just get back to the same state of awareness."
- "If a bug was addressed on the day it was created, it would take an hour to fix; three weeks later, it would take twenty-four hours."
- "When people go on vaction, they are expected to go on vacation, not check e-mail, not check in with the office. If you can't actually take time off without having to make sure everything is going right at the office, the thinking goes, you aren't managing your teams well."
  -" When you'r writing your stories, though, you want to make sure that they're small enough that you can actually estimate them."
