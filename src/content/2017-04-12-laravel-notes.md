Over the years, I have accumulated a lot of notes about various tech projects I have completed. However, I never seem to be able to find a note when I need it. I also tend to bookmark a lot of helpful URLs according to subject area. It would be nice to have a system to tabulate all of the information, index it, and allow for searching.

Since I have been unable to find a good open source tool to accomplish this, I have decided to build my own! I will be using Laravel for this project. This will also give me a good opportunity to learn PostgreSQL. In the past I have used MySQL and SQLite for many of my projects. However, I have recently heard a lot of good recommendations for PostgreSQL. Once I get it built, I will open source it and post it on GitHub to allow anyone else to use it if they like.
