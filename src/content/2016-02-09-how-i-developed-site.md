After a few years, I have finally slowed down long enough to rebuild my personal website. I did a bit of research on static website generators. It seems there were a lot of options out there, but I decided to go with the big player at least for now - Jekyll. Another plus with Jekyll was that I could easily host my website on GitHub for free!
