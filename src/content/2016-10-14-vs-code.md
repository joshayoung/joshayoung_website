After using Atom for a few months, I decided to give Visual Studio Code a try. After a few weeks of use, it really seems more polished than Atom. Although I like many of the features of Atom and still use it occasionally for specific tasks, I find VSCode more enjoyable to use.

The visual interface is more professional and the plugin integration is superb. The best part is that I now have an excellent editor that works on both my Mac and Linux machines and also supports Vim.

I have found a few very nice plugins for this code editor, which I have listed below:

* Code Spellchecker
* Path Intellisense
* TODO Parser
* Vim
* Terminal
* PHP Debug
* Indent 4-to-2
 - Used to convert tabs or 4 spaces into 2 spaces.
