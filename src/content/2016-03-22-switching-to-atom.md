I recently made the switch to Atom from Sublime Text 2. My first thoughts are that the Vim support is much better. Over the years, I have tried a few different code editors, but Atom is by far the best.

I have found the following plugins useful:

- vim-mode
- ex-mode
- color-picker
- relative-numbers
- git-plus
- git-time-machine
- todo-show
