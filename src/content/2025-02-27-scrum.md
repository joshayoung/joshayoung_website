## Introduction

Scrum is a team structure that is organized around a central group of people with certain meeting rythms. A lot of times a kanban board is used, but it is mostly there for visualizing the work and little restrictions are typically placed on the board itself.

### Sprint

A scrum teams works in a sprint cycle which it typically 1 - 3 weeks long. At the end of this process all of the work that was in the sprint should have been completed. Any unfinished work would be moved back to the sprint backlog and re-proritized for the next sprint.

### GIT

- Typically a scrum team works around a gitflow structure that encourages delivers to production at the end of each sprint.
