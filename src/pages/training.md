### <a name='penetration-testing-with-kali-linux'></a>Penetration Testing with Kali Linux

I took this class in preparation for Offensive Security's certification exam ([OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional)). Unfortunately, I did not pass my first exam attempt and have not had time to re-test. After speaking with a few individuals who passed the exam, it seems that no one passes it on their first attempt anyway. For me it was a great way to learn more about security and many different security techniques that relate to web development. For these reasons, the class time alone was extremely beneficial!

### <a name='linux-administration-110'></a>Linux Administration 110 - System Installation and Configuration

Even though I had taken Linux classes in school, my company offered to send me to this class prior to taking on more Linux system administration duties at work. This class was mostly review for me since I had previous Linux experience and training, but it served as a good review and preparation for the classes that followed. This class went over basic Linux information such as the file system, input, output, process management, etc.
