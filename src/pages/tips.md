# Tips

These are some tips for development that I have found helpful. These also serve as helpful future reminders.

* Do not add your IDE files to your repos .gitignore file. Instead add them to a global .gitignore file.
* Before writing any code, build a design with a diagramming tool using (UML, Entity Diagram, etc.) to insure you are programming the right thing.
* Sync with your team on a continual basis through the progress of your work by opening small pull requests to get their feedback.
* Never push production code to master unless it has good tests (unit, integration) backing that code.
* Before building out a new feature test it with a "spike" / "discovery".
  * This discovery work is typically code that you build out quickly that has no tests. It provides a quick way to develop a workable/feasible plan.
