# Axioms

These are some axioms that relate to software development that I have found useful and instructive over the years.

* A Good Function - is very small and does very little (ideally one thing).
* "You will never know less than you know right now." - Practical Object-Oriented Design (book)
* "Make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change." -Kent Beck
* "Depending on an abstraction is always safer than depending on a concretion because by its very nature, the abstraction is more stable." - Practical Object-Oriented Design (book)
* "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." - Abraham Lincoln
* "Slow is smooth smooth is fast" - Navy Seals
