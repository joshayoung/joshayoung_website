# About Me

My name is Josh Young. I am a web developer living and working in Franklin, Tennessee. I enjoy all things tech related. I am not a huge blogger, but I enjoy writing small posts about what I am currently working with or technologies that I am using. Maybe something I say here will help someone in their journey, or at the very least provide a central place for me to document what I have learned when working through new projects.

### My Job

For my day job, I maintain web applications, websites, and other apps for my employer,
[Ramsey Solutions](https://www.daveramsey.com). In a typical day, I work primarily with Rails, Ruby, CSS, SASS, JavaScript and their accompanying technologies such as build tools, testing frameworks, and the like.

In the past, I have had the opportunity to work with many technologies including, but not limited to: PHP, Laravel, Objective-C, C#, ASP.NET and Python. On the [resume](/resume) portion of this site, I have listed some of my job duties in more detail.

### <a id='hobbies'></a> Hobbies

Many of my hobbies relate to technology and development. I enjoy coding and designing web applications and web sites. When it comes to web development, I enjoy the whole stack from front end to back end. Therefore, I spend a significant amount of my free time keeping up with and learning the latest languages and frameworks. When possible, I try to implement this additional knowledge into the software stack that I use at work.

I also spend some of my free time maintaining my home network, firewall, file server, git server, among other open-source applications. I enjoy Linux and FreeBSD so I spend time configuring these systems in my free time as well. As evident by some of my certifications and training, I also dabble in computer security. A good working knowledge of computer security and specifically web application security is very helpful as a web developer. If I am not working on servers or code, I spend my time playing my harmonica, biking, reading, or researching nutrition.

### <a id='podcasts'></a>Recommended Podcasts

Below I have listed the tech podcasts that I currently listen to or have listened to in the past. Podcasts are a great way to keep up with the latest changes in development. Hopefully this list will introduce a good podcast to someone who enjoys learning and keeping up with the latest changes in tech.
