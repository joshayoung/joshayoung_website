### <a name='kali'></a>Penetration Testing with Kali Linux

I took this class in preparation for Offensive Security's certification exam (<a href='https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/'>OSCP</a>). Unfortunately, I did not pass my first exam attempt and have not had time to re-test. After speaking with a few individuals who passed the exam, it seems that no one passes it on their first attempt anyway. For me it was a great way to learn more about security and many different security techniques that relate to web development. For these reasons, the class time alone was extremely beneficial!

### <a name='securityplus'></a>CompTIA Security+ Certification Training
In preparation for the Security+ certification, I took this class covering the fundamentals on the CompTIA Security+ certification exam. This class was offered as a night course by the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).

### <a name='linuxsteelpivot3'></a>Linux Administration 310 - Service Configuration, Management and LAMP Servers

### <a name='linuxsteelpivot2'></a>Linux Administration 210 - System and Network Management

This class was a follow-up to the 110 class and went into further detail. It coved topics such as: Linux networking, DNS, RAID, LVM, authentication, scripting, etc.

### <a name='linuxsteelpivot1'></a>Linux Administration 110 - System Installation and Configuration

Even though I had taken Linux classes in school, my company offered to send me to this class prior to taking on more Linux system administration duties at work. This class was mostly review for me since I had previous Linux experience and training, but it served as a good review and preparation for the classes that followed. This class went over basic Linux information such as the file system, input, output, process management, etc.
