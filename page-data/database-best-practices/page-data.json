So if a users needs to be able to <code>SELECT</code> from a particular table in a database, give them <code>SELECT</code> permission on that table only.</li>\n<li>\n<p>When building user interfaces that allows users to remove database entries, it is best to give the user 'soft delete' permission.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Soft Delete means that a user would be allowed to mark a field as true that would hide a table record. From the front-end, the entry would be removed - giving the appearance of deletion. However, the record would only be marked for removal on the back-end database.</li>\n<li>This way the user would only need <code>UPDATE</code> permission on the database table instead of <code>DELETE</code> permission. Therefore, in the event of a site compromise (such as SQL Injection), the hacker would be working with a database user that had more limited permissions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 20, 2017","path":"/database-best-practices","title":"Database Best Practices"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
